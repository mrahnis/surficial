Problems with labeling:
    the hits from points_to_addresses above will not necessarily retain the point order from the src
    additionally hits may have fewer points than src
    so i need to rethink hits and labels....

How to represent address/event?
	rebase addresses in Alignment?
	make Events class and move some of the point features into there

Select LAS points for terraces:
	las -> terrace polygons
	ground points in terrace polygons -> terrace points
	terrace points -> thinned terrace points
	thinned terrace points -> projected points

drapery:
	add a way to pass chunks of points to sample
	probably not convenient until fiona gets random reads
